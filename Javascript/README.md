# JavaScript Overview

## Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is widely used in web development. It was designed to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. JavaScript is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables the development of client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter document content displayed.

## History

### Creation (1995)

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation, in just 10 days. Initially named **Mocha**, it was quickly renamed to **LiveScript** and then to **JavaScript** as a marketing strategy to ride on the popularity of Java.

### Standardization (1997)

JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International for standardization, resulting in the ECMAScript standard. ECMAScript 1 was released in June 1997.

### Evolution

- **ECMAScript 3 (1999)**: The third edition was the first widely supported version.
- **ECMAScript 4**: Proposed major changes but was abandoned due to community differences.
- **ECMAScript 5 (2009)**: Introduced strict mode, JSON support, and more robust features.
- **ECMAScript 6 (2015)**, also known as **ECMAScript 2015 or ES6**: Brought significant updates like classes, modules, arrow functions, template literals, and more.

### Modern Era

- **Annual Updates**: Since ES6, ECMAScript has adopted a yearly release cycle, leading to consistent additions of new features and improvements.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: The rise of frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue.js** has revolutionized front-end development.

## JavaScript Today

JavaScript has grown beyond the browser and is now a versatile language used in various environments:

- **Client-Side**: JavaScript remains the dominant language for web development. Modern libraries and frameworks enhance the development of complex, interactive web applications.
- **Server-Side**: **Node.js** has made JavaScript a powerful language for server-side development, allowing developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, leading to full-stack development capabilities.
- **Mobile Development**: Frameworks like **React Native** enable developers to write mobile applications using JavaScript.
- **Desktop Applications**: Tools like **Electron** allow for the development of cross-platform desktop apps using JavaScript.
- **Emerging Technologies**: JavaScript is being used in **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Blockchain** applications.

## Development and Maintenance

JavaScript's development and maintenance are overseen by **TC39**, a committee of the ECMA International. TC39 includes representatives from major tech companies such as:

- **Microsoft**
- **Google**
- **Apple**
- **Mozilla**
- **Facebook**

The committee meets regularly to discuss and evolve the ECMAScript standard, ensuring that JavaScript continues to meet the needs of developers and the modern web.
